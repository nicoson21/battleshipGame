Q1 Project Proposal - Thacher
Submitted: 3/7/16

Objective: to design, create, and deploy an operational battleship game which encompasses the skills and methods covered up by the Q1 curriculum

Project Description: Battleship Game
♣	Audience: potential players (classmates and instructors)
♣	Outputs:
o	Development: operational battleship web app game (modeled after the Milton Bradley game)
o	User: Battleship game experience
♣	Required Inputs:
o	player choices/guesses on a game board attempting to locate the battleships placed by the computer

Feature List:
User Interface:
♣	HTML/CSS game board layout and player pieces
Functionality:
♣	Computer generates one or more “ships” or targets that the player will look for
♣	Player is able to repeatedly guess where computer has hidden ship(s) on the game board grid and receive feedback on whether or not their guess has been a “hit”
♣	Player wins when ships have been “sunk” (all ships/targets have been correctly guessed) or reaches a predetermined number of guesses

Possible Additional Features:
♣	Upgrade on CSS/graphics used for game board and pieces
♣	Player to set their own game board and have the computer play against them
♣	Build a test file to act as the user and test functionality throughout development

Technologies to be included in development:

HTML
♣	Make good use of semantic HTML tags
♣	Be well-indented, validated, etc.
♣	Include some embedded media (images, audio, video, canvas)
♣	Optionally, use a templating engine
CSS
♣	Use either SASS or a styling framework like Bootstrap, or Foundation
♣	If you are using Bootstrap, please consider theming with something like bootswatch, customizing the download with SASS, or a customizer
♣	Be well-indented and clean
♣	Split code into separate files where appropriate
♣	Responsive design optional but strongly encouraged

JavaScript
♣	DOM manipulation via JavaScript or jQuery
♣	Integration with some external API via XHR or AJAX
♣	Response to some user-initiated events
♣	Well-indented, linted, and use excellent variable names
♣	Split code into separate files where appropriate
♣	User Input
♣	Use at least one web form
♣	Validate user input
Workflow
♣	Use wireframes to create your layouts before you build them
♣	Use a feature-branch workflow for your user stories
