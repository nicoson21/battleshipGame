Some features of this project include:
- Gameboard logic for ship placement is based on a recursive function that individually places the ships without overlap
- Hit/Miss scoreboard tracks each “hits” and “miss” to the left of the game board
- Alert before being taken to a win or lose page, both giving the player the option to play again
- HTML form with required fields and a player age limit
- Bootstrap/CSS
